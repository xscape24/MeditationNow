        <h2>1. Loving-Kindness Meditation</h2>
        <p>This meditation, also known as Metta meditation, focuses on cultivating love and compassion for yourself and others. Begin by sitting in a comfortable position and silently repeat phrases like "May I be happy, may I be healthy." Gradually extend these feelings to others, including loved ones, acquaintances, and even those you have difficulties with.</p>

        <h2>2. Guided Meditation</h2>
        <p>Guided meditation involves listening to a teacher or recording that provides directions on how to meditate. It can include visualizations, relaxation techniques, or specific goals. This is an excellent method for beginners to learn meditation.</p>

        <h2>3. Mantra Meditation</h2>
        <p>Mantra meditation involves silently repeating a word or phrase (mantra) to focus the mind. Popular in traditions like Transcendental Meditation, this practice uses the mantra to transcend distracting thoughts. Examples include "Om" or other personal affirmations.</p>

        <h2>4. Open Awareness Meditation</h2>
        <p>This form of meditation encourages a state of mindfulness by observing thoughts, feelings, and sensations as they arise, without clinging to or rejecting them. It promotes a sense of openness and acceptance of the present moment.</p>
