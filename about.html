            <h2>My Journey into Meditation</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I’m Eben! Meditation became a part of my life during a time when I was battling OCD and anxiety. 
                I needed a way to regain control of my thoughts and emotions, and that’s when I found the 
                <strong>Waking Up app</strong> by Sam Harris. 
                Starting with just 10 minutes of mindfulness meditation before work each day, I discovered the transformative power of stillness and awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, this practice worked wonders for my mental well-being, helping me navigate life with a newfound clarity and calm. 
                Now, I’m passionate about sharing this gift with others through <strong>Meditation Now</strong>.

            <h2>What Inspires Me</h2>
            <p>
                My inspiration comes from a deep desire to help others find peace amidst the chaos of modern life. 
                I believe that meditation is more than just a practice—it’s a journey toward understanding yourself and the world around you.
