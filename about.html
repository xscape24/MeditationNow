            <h2>My Meditation Journey</h2>
            <p>My journey with meditation began when I was struggling with OCD and anxiety. I knew I needed something to calm my mind, so I decided to try meditation. It was a game-changer for me, and I’ve been practicing regularly ever since. Initially, I used the Waking Up app by Sam Harris, where I committed to meditating for at least 10 minutes before work each day. This small but consistent practice helped me build a solid foundation for my mental well-being.</p>
            <p>Now, I am passionate about sharing the benefits of meditation with others. Whether you're new to meditation or have been practicing for years, my goal is to help you discover how meditation can improve your physical, emotional, and mental health.</p>

I’ve personally experienced the physical, mental, and emotional benefits of meditation, and I want to pass on these insights to you.</p>
